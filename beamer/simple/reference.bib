Less well documented and understood, however, are the potential economic and societal impacts of the disruption of critical technological systems by severe space weather.   As a first step toward determining the socioeconomic impacts of extreme space weather events and addressing the questions of space weather risk assessment and management, a public workshop was held in May 2008. The workshop brought together representatives of industry, the government, and academia to consider both direct and collateral effects of severe space weather events, the current state of the space weather services infrastructure in the United States, the needs of users of space weather data and services, and the ramifications of future technological developments for contemporary society's vulnerability to space weather. The workshop concluded with a discussion of un- or underexplored topics that would yield the greatest benefits in space weather risk management.   ",

abstract = "Objectives Missing data imputation is an important task in cases where it is crucial to use all available data and not discard records with missing values. This work evaluates the performance of several statistical and machine learning imputation methods that were used to predict recurrence in patients in an extensive real breast cancer data set. Materials and methods Imputation methods based on statistical techniques, e.g., mean, hot-deck and multiple imputation, and machine learning techniques, e.g., multi-layer perceptron (MLP), self-organisation maps (SOM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), were applied to data collected through the “El Álamo-I” project, and the results were then compared to those obtained from the listwise deletion (LD) imputation method. The database includes demographic, therapeutic and recurrence-survival information from 3679 women with operable invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 32 different hospitals belonging to the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM). The accuracies of predictions on early cancer relapse were measured using artificial neural networks (ANNs), in which different \{ANNs\} were estimated using the data sets with imputed missing values. Results The imputation methods based on machine learning algorithms outperformed imputation statistical methods in the prediction of patient outcome. Friedman’s test revealed a significant difference ( p = 0.0091 ) in the observed area under the \{ROC\} curve (AUC) values, and the pairwise comparison test showed that the \{AUCs\} for MLP, \{KNN\} and \{SOM\} were significantly higher ( p = 0.0053 , p = 0.0048 and p = 0.0071 , respectively) than the \{AUC\} from the LD-based prognosis model. Conclusion The methods based on machine learning techniques were the most suited for the imputation of missing values and led to a significant enhancement of prognosis accuracy compared to imputation methods based on statistical procedures.
